# This is a larger example typo dictionary containing 400 entries. It builds to
# a table of about 6000 bytes, so you'll need a keyboard with a generous
# amount of free firmware space to use the full dictionary. Alternatively, pick
# out a subset of entries to a separate file, then build a table from that.
#
# Dictionary syntax:
# Each line of this file defines one typo correction entry with the syntax
# "typo -> correction". Typos and corrections are case insensitive, and any
# whitespace before or after the typo and correction is ignored. The typo must be
# only the letters a-z, or the special character : representing a word break.
#
# For documentation about how to use this dictionary, see
# https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/autocorrection
